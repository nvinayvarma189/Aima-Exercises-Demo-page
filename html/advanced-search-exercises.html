          <p><strong>4.1</strong> Give the name of the algorithm that results from each of the following
          special cases:</p>
          <ol>
          <li><p>Local beam search with $k = 1$.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Local beam search with one initial state and no limit on the number
          of states retained.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Simulated annealing with $T = 0$ at all times (and omitting the
          termination test).</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Simulated annealing with $T=\infty$ at all times.</p>

          <li><p>Genetic algorithm with population size $N = 1$.</p>
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>4.2</strong> Exercise <a href="#/">brio-exercise</a> considers the problem of
          building railway tracks under the assumption that pieces fit exactly
          with no slack. Now consider the real problem, in which pieces don’t fit
          exactly but allow for up to 10 degrees of rotation to either side of the
          “proper” alignment. Explain how to formulate the problem so it could be
          solved by simulated annealing.</p>
          <p><strong>4.3</strong> In this exercise, we explore the use of local search methods to solve
          TSPs of the type defined in Exercise <a href="#/">tsp-mst-exercise</a>.</p>
          <ol>
          <li><p>Implement and test a hill-climbing method to solve TSPs. Compare the
          results with optimal solutions obtained from the A* algorithm with
          the MST heuristic (Exercise <a href="#/">tsp-mst-exercise</a>).</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Repeat part (a) using a genetic algorithm instead of hill climbing.
          You may want to consult @Larranaga+al:1999 for some suggestions for representations.</p>
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>4.4</strong> [hill-climbing-exercise]Generate a large number of 8-puzzle and
          8-queens instances and solve them (where possible) by hill climbing
          (steepest-ascent and first-choice variants), hill climbing with random
          restart, and simulated annealing. Measure the search cost and percentage
          of solved problems and graph these against the optimal solution cost.
          Comment on your results.</p>
          <p><strong>4.5</strong> [cond-plan-repeated-exercise] The <strong>And-Or-Graph-Search</strong> algorithm in
          Figure <a href="#/">and-or-graph-search-algorithm</a> checks for
          repeated states only on the path from the root to the current state.
          Suppose that, in addition, the algorithm were to store
          <em>every</em> visited state and check against that list. (See in
          Figure <a href="#/">breadth-first-search-algorithm</a> for an example.)
          Determine the information that should be stored and how the algorithm
          should use that information when a repeated state is found.
          (<em>Hint</em>: You will need to distinguish at least between
          states for which a successful subplan was constructed previously and
          states for which no subplan could be found.) Explain how to use labels,
          as defined in Section <a href="#/">cyclic-plan-section</a>, to avoid
          having multiple copies of subplans.</p>
          <p><strong>4.6</strong> [cond-loop-exercise]Explain precisely how to modify the <strong>And-Or-Graph-Search</strong> algorithm to
          generate a cyclic plan if no acyclic plan exists. You will need to deal
          with three issues: labeling the plan steps so that a cyclic plan can
          point back to an earlier part of the plan, modifying <strong>Or-Search</strong> so that it
          continues to look for acyclic plans after finding a cyclic plan, and
          augmenting the plan representation to indicate whether a plan is cyclic.
          Show how your algorithm works on (a) the slippery vacuum world, and (b)
          the slippery, erratic vacuum world. You might wish to use a computer
          implementation to check your results.</p>
          <p><strong>4.7</strong> In Section <a href="#/">conformant-section</a> we introduced belief
          states to solve sensorless search problems. A sequence of actions solves
          a sensorless problem if it maps every physical state in the initial
          belief state $b$ to a goal state. Suppose the agent knows $h^*(s)$, the
          true optimal cost of solving the physical state $s$ in the fully
          observable problem, for every state $s$ in $b$. Find an admissible
          heuristic $h(b)$ for the sensorless problem in terms of these costs, and
          prove its admissibilty. Comment on the accuracy of this heuristic on the
          sensorless vacuum problem of
          Figure <a href="#/">vacuum2-sets-figure</a>. How well does A* perform?</p>
          <p><strong>4.8</strong> [belief-state-superset-exercise] This exercise explores
          subset–superset relations between belief states in sensorless or
          partially observable environments.</p>
          <ol>
          <li><p>Prove that if an action sequence is a solution for a belief state
          $b$, it is also a solution for any subset of $b$. Can anything be
          said about supersets of $b$?</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Explain in detail how to modify graph search for sensorless problems
          to take advantage of your answers in (a).</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Explain in detail how to modify and–or search for
          partially observable problems, beyond the modifications you describe
          in (b).</p>
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>4.9</strong> [multivalued-sensorless-exercise] On page <a href="#/">multivalued-sensorless-page</a> it was assumed
          that a given action would have the same cost when executed in any
          physical state within a given belief state. (This leads to a
          belief-state search problem with well-defined step costs.) Now consider
          what happens when the assumption does not hold. Does the notion of
          optimality still make sense in this context, or does it require
          modification? Consider also various possible definitions of the “cost”
          of executing an action in a belief state; for example, we could use the
          <em>minimum</em> of the physical costs; or the
          <em>maximum</em>; or a cost <em>interval</em> with the lower
          bound being the minimum cost and the upper bound being the maximum; or
          just keep the set of all possible costs for that action. For each of
          these, explore whether A* (with modifications if necessary) can return
          optimal solutions.</p>
          <p><strong>4.10</strong> [vacuum-solvable-exercise]Consider the sensorless version of the
          erratic vacuum world. Draw the belief-state space reachable from the
          initial belief state $\{{{\rm 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}}\}$, and explain why the
          problem is unsolvable.</p>
          <p><strong>4.11</strong> [vacuum-solvable-exercise]Consider the sensorless version of the
          erratic vacuum world. Draw the belief-state space reachable from the
          initial belief state $\{{{\rm 1,3,5,7}}\}$, and explain why the problem
          is unsolvable.</p>
          <p><strong>4.12</strong> [path-planning-agent-exercise]We can turn the navigation problem in
          Exercise <a href="#/">path-planning-exercise</a> into an environment as
          follows:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>The percept will be a list of the positions, <em>relative to the
          agent</em>, of the visible vertices. The percept does
          <em>not</em> include the position of the robot! The robot must
          learn its own position from the map; for now, you can assume that
          each location has a different “view.”</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Each action will be a vector describing a straight-line path
          to follow. If the path is unobstructed, the action succeeds;
          otherwise, the robot stops at the point where its path first
          intersects an obstacle. If the agent returns a zero motion vector
          and is at the goal (which is fixed and known), then the environment
          teleports the agent to a <em>random location</em> (not inside
          an obstacle).</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>The performance measure charges the agent 1 point for each unit of
          distance traversed and awards 1000 points each time the goal
          is reached.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Implement this environment and a problem-solving agent for it. After
          each teleportation, the agent will need to formulate a new problem,
          which will involve discovering its current location.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Document your agent’s performance (by having the agent generate
          suitable commentary as it moves around) and report its performance
          over 100 episodes.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Modify the environment so that 30% of the time the agent ends up at
          an unintended destination (chosen randomly from the other visible
          vertices if any; otherwise, no move at all). This is a crude model
          of the motion errors of a real robot. Modify the agent so that when
          such an error is detected, it finds out where it is and then
          constructs a plan to get back to where it was and resume the
          old plan. Remember that sometimes getting back to where it was might
          also fail! Show an example of the agent successfully overcoming two
          successive motion errors and still reaching the goal.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Now try two different recovery schemes after an error: (1) head for
          the closest vertex on the original route; and (2) replan a route to
          the goal from the new location. Compare the performance of the three
          recovery schemes. Would the inclusion of search costs affect the
          comparison?</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Now suppose that there are locations from which the view
          is identical. (For example, suppose the world is a grid with
          square obstacles.) What kind of problem does the agent now face?
          What do solutions look like?</p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>4.13</strong> [online-offline-exercise]Suppose that an agent is in a $3 \times 3$
          maze environment like the one shown in
          Figure <a href="#/">maze-3x3-figure</a>. The agent knows that its
          initial location is (1,1), that the goal is at (3,3), and that the
          actions <em>Up</em>, <em>Down</em>, <em>Left</em>, <em>Right</em> have their usual
          effects unless blocked by a wall. The agent does <em>not</em> know
          where the internal walls are. In any given state, the agent perceives
          the set of legal actions; it can also tell whether the state is one it
          has visited before.</p>
          <ol>
          <li><p>Explain how this online search problem can be viewed as an offline
          search in belief-state space, where the initial belief state
          includes all possible environment configurations. How large is the
          initial belief state? How large is the space of belief states?</p>

          </ol>
          <p>Notice that this contingency plan is a solution for <em>every

          <p><strong>4.16</strong> Like DFS, online DFS is incomplete for reversible state spaces with
          infinite paths. For example, suppose that states are points on the
          infinite two-dimensional grid and actions are unit vectors $(1,0)$,
          $(0,1)$, $(-1,0)$, $(0,-1)$, tried in that order. Show that online DFS
          starting at $(0,0)$ will not reach $(1,-1)$. Suppose the agent can
          observe, in addition to its current state, all successor states and the
          actions that would lead to them. Write an algorithm that is complete
          even for bidirected state spaces with infinite paths. What states does
