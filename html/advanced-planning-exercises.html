<p><strong>11.2</strong> You have a number of trucks with which to deliver a set of packages.
Each package starts at some location on a grid map, and has a
destination somewhere else. Each truck is directly controlled by moving
forward and turning. Construct a hierarchy of high-level actions for
this problem. What knowledge about the solution does your hierarchy
encode?</p>
<p><strong>11.3</strong> [HLA-unique-exercise] Suppose that a high-level action has exactly one
implementation as a sequence of primitive actions. Give an algorithm for
computing its preconditions and effects, given the complete refinement
hierarchy and schemas for the primitive actions.</p>
<p><strong>11.4</strong> Suppose that the optimistic reachable set of a high-level plan is a
superset of the goal set; can anything be concluded about whether the
plan achieves the goal? What if the pessimistic reachable set doesn’t
intersect the goal set? Explain.</p>
<p><strong>11.5</strong> [HLA-progression-exercise] Write an algorithm that takes an initial
state (specified by a set of propositional literals) and a sequence of
HLAs (each defined by preconditions and angelic specifications of
optimistic and pessimistic reachable sets) and computes optimistic and
pessimistic descriptions of the reachable set of the sequence.</p>
<p><strong>11.6</strong> In Figure <a href="#/">jobshop-cpm-figure</a> we showed how to describe
actions in a scheduling problem by using separate fields for , , and .
Now suppose we wanted to combine scheduling with nondeterministic
planning, which requires nondeterministic and conditional effects.
Consider each of the three fields and explain if they should remain
separate fields, or if they should become effects of the action. Give an
example for each of the three.</p>
<p><strong>11.7</strong> Some of the operations in standard programming languages can be modeled
as actions that change the state of the world. For example, the
assignment operation changes the contents of a memory location, and the
print operation changes the state of the output stream. A program
consisting of these operations can also be considered as a plan, whose
goal is given by the specification of the program. Therefore, planning
algorithms can be used to construct programs that achieve a given
specification.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Write an action schema for the assignment operator (assigning the
value of one variable to another). Remember that the original value
will be overwritten!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Show how object creation can be used by a planner to produce a plan
for exchanging the values of two variables by using a
temporary variable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>11.8</strong> Consider the following argument: In a framework that allows uncertain
initial states, <strong>nondeterministic effects</strong>
are just a notational convenience, not a source of additional
representational power. For any action schema $a$ with nondeterministic
effect $P \lor Q$, we could always replace it with the conditional
effects ${{\mbox{}}~R{:}~P} \land
{{\mbox{}}~\lnot R{:}~Q}$, which in turn can be
reduced to two regular actions. The proposition $R$ stands for a random
proposition that is unknown in the initial state and for which there are
no sensing actions. Is this argument correct? Consider separately two
cases, one in which only one instance of action schema $a$ is in the
plan, the other in which more than one instance is.</p>
<p><strong>11.9</strong> [conformant-flip-literal-exercise] Suppose the ${Flip}$ action
always changes the truth value of variable $L$. Show how to define its
effects by using an action schema with conditional effects. Show that,
despite the use of conditional effects, a 1-CNF belief state
representation remains in 1-CNF after a ${Flip}$.</p>
<p><strong>11.10</strong> In the blocks world we were forced to introduce two action schemas,
${Move}$ and ${MoveToTable}$, in order to maintain the ${Clear}$
predicate properly. Show how conditional effects can be used to
represent both of these cases with a single action.</p>
<p><strong>11.11</strong> [alt-vacuum-exercise] Conditional effects were illustrated for the
${Suck}$ action in the vacuum world—which square becomes clean depends
on which square the robot is in. Can you think of a new set of
propositional variables to define states of the vacuum world, such that
${Suck}$ has an <em>unconditional</em> description? Write out
the descriptions of ${Suck}$, ${Left}$, and ${Right}$, using your
propositions, and demonstrate that they suffice to describe all possible
states of the world.</p>
<p><strong>11.12</strong> Find a suitably dirty carpet, free of obstacles, and vacuum it. Draw the
path taken by the vacuum cleaner as accurately as you can. Explain it,
with reference to the forms of planning discussed in this chapter.</p>
<p><strong>11.13</strong> The following quotes are from the backs of shampoo bottles. Identify
each as an unconditional, conditional, or execution-monitoring plan. (a)
“Lather. Rinse. Repeat.” (b) “Apply shampoo to scalp and let it remain
for several minutes. Rinse and repeat if necessary.” (c) “See a doctor
if problems persist.”</p>
<p><strong>11.14</strong> Consider the following problem: A patient arrives at the doctor’s office
with symptoms that could have been caused either by dehydration or by
disease $D$ (but not both). There are two possible actions: ${Drink}$,
which unconditionally cures dehydration, and ${Medicate}$, which cures
disease $D$ but has an undesirable side effect if taken when the patient
is dehydrated. Write the problem description, and diagram a sensorless
plan that solves the problem, enumerating all relevant possible worlds.</p>
<p><strong>11.15</strong> To the medication problem in the previous exercise, add a ${Test}$
action that has the conditional effect ${CultureGrowth}$ when
${Disease}$ is true and in any case has the perceptual effect
${Known}({CultureGrowth})$. Diagram a conditional plan that solves
the problem and minimizes the use of the ${Medicate}$ action.</p>
